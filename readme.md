`fun` is a command line application whose sole purpose is to call the `icndb.com` API and print a random Chuck Norris Fact to the screen.

## Usage

`fun`

## Roadmap

### Alternative Names

The ICNDB offers an alternative name function which permits users to specify first and last names other than Chuck and Norris to be used in query results. At present, fun offers no such support. We'd like to add the ability for users to supply alternate first and/or last names for use in results.
