fun

`fun` is a command line application whose sole purpose is to call the `icndb.com` API and print a random Chuck Norris Fact to the screen.

## Usage

`fun`

## Roadmap

#### Categories ####

The ICNDB allows for calls for random jokes to either *include* or *exclude* certain categories of jokes entirely, but the application has no support whatever for this functionality. Many jokes don't seem to be categorized at all, so this is a lower priority, but--with everything else now working pretty well--it'll probably be the next item on the to-do list, such as it is.

Existing command option struct has potential to add support for this.
